Generate a cohesive and concise summary that captures the essence of the video by analyzing the provided list of individual frame captions. 
Ensure the final caption reflects the overall narrative, conveys the context and meaning, and integrates the temporal flow between scenes 
seamlessly. Address any variations in tone or details to produce a unified and fluid description. Enhance clarity and avoid repetitive 
language, ensuring the summary is both engaging and descriptive without unnecessary redundancy. Highlight key events, actions, or emotions 
to create a vivid and compelling representation of the video's content, while maintaining a polished and natural flow. Limit the summary 
to 128 words for precision and brevity.

Don't add any riferiment to the fact that you're watching a video (e.g. avoid stuff like "in this video we can see....", "in these frames ...")

In addiction, if frames description are very similar, don't focus on the fact that the object is steady, talk more about the context itself.

Avoid stuff like this: "It seems like you've listed the same image multiple times." when the frames' captions are similar.
